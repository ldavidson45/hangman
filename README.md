# Word Scramble
## By: Liz Davidson


The object of this game is to unscramble the letters to create a word. If you are successful, your points will increase by the number of letters in each word you unscramble.

To start:

Click "New Game"

Jumbled letters will appear on the screen. You have unlimited time to guess the correct word, but you only have one chance to guess correctly. 

Once you think you know the word, type your guess in the input at the bottom of the screen.

NOTE: you have to type your guess in all lowercase letters.


You only have three lives. If you guess a wrong word, you lose a life. The score and number of lives remaining are located on the right side of the page.

The game ends when you guess three wrong words.
